## Description
Traditional census data are ill-suited for uncovering the true population patterns and underlying social and
economic dynamics in China as the census relies on information of population with registered household status.
A large number of migrant workers are registered rural residents but spend most of a year working in cities that
are hundreds or even thousands of miles away. It is termed “annual spatial mismatch” here for the separation of
registered residence and workplace in China, in contrast to “spatial mismatch” that is known in the urban
commuting literature in the west but on a daily basis. Big geo-data, such as the mobile app data, afford us a rare
opportunity to examine this unique phenomenon. Specifically, this research uses a mobile app dataset of two
epochs, i.e., prior to and during the Chinese Spring Festival, to capture the population patterns before and after
the migrant workers return home, respectively. The difference between them reflects distinctive roles of an area
plays in labor market, termed “source-sink areas”. A GIS-automated regionalization method is used to delineate
China into hierarchical “source-sink” areas, characterizing various urbanization levels or distinctive roles in
labor market. The study demonstrates the value of using human mobility data in urban and regional analysis on
issues that were previously infeasible, especially in study areas without reliable data.
